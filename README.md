Task For Ishan Garg

**The Task Prompt**

Using the API at swapi.dev, print a formatted list of Star Wars characters and at least five pieces of information about each of them. Selecting a character should also provide a list of information about vehicles they are associated with.

We’ve left this prompt intentionally vague. Focus on showing us what you’re amazing at! 

**How To Run The Project**

* Take the pull of the project. Please make sure Node is installed
* Run the command,
```npm install```
* Run the command to start the server,
```npm run devStart```
* Server starts on localhost:3000

**Methodology**

*Libraries Used*
* Server side: ExpressJS, EJS (template engine)
* Client Side: VanillaJS

*Why Javascript?*
Based on the task description, it made sense to complete the task in JS and HTML as the combination allows for more control over the visuals of the list compared to python, and thus provides a user friendly interface for interacting with the list. 

In addition to the interface element, JS also has ExpressJS which is a very lightweight server compared to libraries such as Django in Python or Spring in Java which are much heavier.
